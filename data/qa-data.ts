For example, you cannot solve transportation-related issues for everyone in the class because not everyone commutes the same way. Be clear about how your persona gets to school.

Don’t be specific. “How might we aid student communication so they can share supplies?” could yield multiple communication responses (like an app, website, social media, smoke signals, etc.) and you can then determine the best mode of communication from there. whereas “How might we make a website so students can share supplies?” assumes that a website is the answer.",

Both fields use the same tools, however a UX designer might recommend both process and physical design solutions (like an interface design, new check out counter experience, etc) that solve the pain points in a process. Management consulting usually focuses on business structure that could be more policy focused, but aren’t designing objects to solve the problem.

    answer: "This is not a type design class, so Nunito Sans has been provided as a suitable neutral typeface. You can change the typeface, as Prof. Cheng discussed during class, but changing the typeface will add an element to critique of your craft and storytelling, which may or may not help your grade. It is up to you as the designer to choose what is appropriate.",

    question: "What are the primary differences between Photoshop and Affinity?",
    answer: "While both Photoshop (introduced in the 90s) and Affinity Photo (introduced in the 2010s) are image editing software, the key difference lies in that Photoshop is a more comprehensive and powerful tool with a wider range of advanced features, particularly for complex image manipulations and professional graphic design, while Affinity Photo is considered a more user-friendly and affordable alternative, particularly strong for basic photo editing and offering a smoother workflow for many users, especially with its streamlined interface and faster performance.",

Most likely, you will spend more time learning your camera and taking pictures at the beginning (experimenting) and less time at the end because you’ll know what you’re looking for and what camera settings you like (refining).

    question: "Is it possible to share supplies with other design students?",
    answer: "It is recommended that students have their own supplies. Items like cutting mats and xacto knives could be shared if they remain easily accessible to everyone and you are not in need of them at the same time (which may cause conflicts during a deadline\\!).",

    question: "Can I do business and design simultaneously?",
    answer: "Consult your academic advisor. It can be challenging to do two majors due to conflicting required course schedules. Design classes must be taken in sequence and are often only offered once per year. However, it may be easier for you pending the credits you are bringing with you from high school, another university, or perhaps another scenario. Never hurts to have the conversation\\!",
